# Changelog

Notable changes to PrimusClaw. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## Versioning

PrimusClaw is pre-1.0. Until a `v1.0.0` tag exists, treat every interface as
subject to change and pin what you deploy.

Three things are versioned separately, and they do not currently move together:

| Artifact | Versioned by |
|---|---|
| Source | git tags (`v*`), which also trigger the image build |
| Container images | the git tag on a tag push, otherwise `latest` plus a build timestamp |
| Helm charts | each chart's own `version` in `Chart.yaml` |

**`latest` is the chart default and is a moving target.** For anything you
intend to reproduce, set an explicit image tag — `--set image.tag=<tag>` — and
record it.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial public release of PrimusClaw: the Claw agent harness (`claw/`), the
  Agent Sandbox control-plane fork (`sandbox/`), the long-term memory plane
  (`memory/`), and the whole-stack installer.
- LiteLLM chart support for existing credential Secrets, additional container
  environment entries, and configurable LiteLLM settings.

### Fixed
- LiteLLM deployment now handles callback lists and existing Secrets without
  copying database or master credentials into Helm release values. This applies
  from the next revision onward; revisions written earlier still hold both in
  plain text. See "Credentials already in the release history" in
  `deploy/litellm/README.md` for removing them and for the rotation order that
  does not strand model credentials encrypted with the old master key.

Call out anything that changes behaviour for an existing deployment under
**Changed**, with the setting that restores the old behaviour where one exists.
Feature flags that default off are the usual case — see CLAW_MEMORY_ENABLED and
CLAW_SKILL_EVOLUTION_ENABLED in claw/.env.example for the pattern.
